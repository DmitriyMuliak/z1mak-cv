## Specify files and folders in your workspace context

https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/chat-gemini#specify_files_and_folders_in_your_workspace_context

- You can specify files or folders in your workspace for Gemini Code Assist to use as context. When you specify a folder, Gemini Code Assist uses the files in the folder as well as the files in subfolders as context.

**note** When you include a folder, Gemini Code Assist selects up to the first 100 files it finds within the folder and its subfolders. If you require codebase awareness beyond this limit, you may want to consider use of code customization.
