## Exclude files from Gemini Code Assist use

Gemini Code Assist supports excluding files from your context for code generation, code completion, code transformation, and chat. For Enterprise users, this also includes code customization.

In many scenarios, you'll have specific files or subtrees that you don't want to have included in your context.

You can exclude these files through the use of an <b>.aiexclude or .gitignore</b> file. <b>Gemini CLI users</b> can exclude files by using a <b>.geminiignore file.</b>
